%
% Tuning parameters are given by mcmc_def structure, it has the following
% inputs
%
% nstep:
%       Number of MCMC steps, default is 10,000.
%
% nabtch:
%       Number of batch size used for adaptive changing the mcmc jump size
%       and empirical estimation of the covariance, default is 50.
%
% rate:
%       Target accceptance rate, default is 0.58
%
% sigma:
%       exp(sigma) for the proposal step size
%
% V:
%       Eigenvectors of the Hessian at the MAP
%
% d:
%       Eigenvalues of the Hessian at the MAP
%
% Options for saving outputs:
%
% save_bacth:
%       The batch size for saving mcmc history, default is 1.
%
% projection:
%       A set of vectors for projecting the MCMC sample trace of the
%       parameters, default is [], for memory saving.
%
% save_all:
%       A flag indicates save the entire MCMC trace of parameters, default
%       is false. Only turn on with sufficient amount of memory
%
% Pass-in function required:
%
% [minus_log_post, minus_log_likelihood, grad] = minus_log_post(v)
%
% In the examples we have, the following is used
% minus_log_post = @(v) minus_log_post_mcmc(mesh, obs, prior, param, FEM, v)
%
% input:
%       v, parameters equipped with identity prior covariance
%
% output:
%       minus_log_post, minus_log_likelihood, and grad, where grad is the
%       gradient of minus_log_post w.r.t. v
%
% This function is passed-in by the structure mcmc_def, e.g.,
% mcmc_def.minus_log_post = @(v) minus_log_post_mcmc(..., v);
% where ... are used provided data structures for setup the forward
% simulation, and evaluating posterior distribution, this function only
% pass-in one variable v.
%
% Note on the the Hessian:
%
% We use the computational parameters v = inv_sqrt(C)u, all the operations
% are defined on the computational parameters.
%
% Let H denote the Hessian of the llkd, and C the prior covariance, then
% V diag(d) V'= C^{0.5} H C^{0.5}.
%
% In the examples supplied, V and d are given by:
% [V, d] = generalized_eigen(mesh, obs, prior, param, FEM, y, 1E-5, ...
%               ceil(obs.N_obs*3));
% User has to supplied their own version for different models
